## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been enjoying coding every since I started it. I love problem solving, doing quests and being skillful. Programming aligns with my values because of measurable complexity, cleanliness and easiness of producing helpful for people products. I work in web development primarily specialising with backend. My favourite language is Python and I tolerate Javascript. I'm looking for exprience, friends and network, passionately willing to learn new stuff. Let's chat if you are hiring or wanna work with me!
