## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Dmitry Savkov 

I've enjoyed coding since I started, finding fun in problem-solving and becoming proficient. I like programming for its avaliability to produce value, opportunities for innovative projects and logical thinking. I specialize in web development, primarily focusing on back-end technologies, my favorite language is Python, but I also tolerate JavaScript. I'm eager to gain experience, make friends, and collaborate with partners while continuously learning and improving my skills. If you're hiring or interested in working together (not necessarily formally), let's chat!
