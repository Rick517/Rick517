## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been enjoying coding every since I started it. I love problem solving, doing quests and being skillful. So programming is perfectly aligned with my values. I work in web development primarily specialising with backend. My favourite language is Python and I tolerate Javascript. I'm looking for exprience, friends and partners, passionately willing to learn new stuff and improve my skills. Let's chat if you are hiring or wanna work with me!
